2.1 Summarize various security measures and their purposes
	Physical security
		Access control vestibule - 
			All doors normally unlocked 
				Opening one door causes others to lock 
			All doors normally locked, need to badge in to unlock door 
				Other doors stay locked until this one is locked 
			For one at a time access, or group control 
			
		Badge reader - Magnetic swipe, RFID, NFC
			Could be for time clocks, securty guard ID, access
		Video surverillance - CCTV (Closed circuit television)
			Additional capabilities, like license plate identification, facial recognition
			Multiple cameras networked together and recorded ove time 
			Could be 24/7, or motion sensing
		Alarm systems
			Circuit based - changes in environment. Like door or window is opened. 
			Motion detection - Identify motion without a camera 
			Duress - Push a button, by a person 
		Motion sensors - []
		Door locks 
			Conventional - lock and key
			Deadbolt - Physical bolt, metal between door and door frame 
			Electronic - Keyless, PIN 
			Token-based - RFID badge, magnetic swipe, key fob
			Biometric - hand, finger, retina prints 
			Multi-factor - many of these simulatneously 
		Equipment locks - Guards access to data center hardware 
		Guards
			Security guard - physical protection at the facility
				Validates ID of existing employess 
				Manages guest access 
			ID Badge - picture, name, deatils worn at all times 
			Access list - phyical list of names enforced by guard 
			Visitor log 
		Bollards - Prevent access, or restrict access
			People can walk in, but no vehicles, etc. 
			Can be safety as well 
			Extreme cases like a moat
		Fences - An obvious guard built around a perimeter 
			Transparent or opaque, robust
	Physical security for staff 
		Key fobs - Small RFID key, add to keychain 
			Replaces a physical key, in a smaller form factor 
		Smart cards - Certificate based authentication 
			Integrated or external card reader authenticates the card, "something you have" 
			Better to combine with a password "something you know" 
		Keys - Rare, standalone, cheaper. Like a safe, storage bin, cabinet
			Key cabinet - for organization with lots of keys that various employees need 
				With a formal check in and check out 
				Log of borrowers 
				Collateral to ensure return 
		Biometrics - Stores mathematical representation of a bio reading, not a picture 
			Difficult to "change" 
			Not foolproof but useful, especially in combination with others 
			Retina scanner - Uniqe capillary structure in the back of eye 
			Fingerprint scanner 
			Palmprint scanner 
		Lighting - More light is more security. Attackers avoid light, cameras can see better 
			Specialized design depending on use. Angle of light, amount to see details, etc. 
		Magentometers - metal detector. Passive scanning 
			Not useful for non metal devices 
	Logical security 
		Principle of least privilege - Rights and permissions shoudl be set to bare minimum 
			All user accounts must be limited 
			Same with applications. Prevents malware from gaining higher access 
			Don't give users admin rights 
		ACLs (Access control lists) - Allow or deny traffic through network or access to share 
			Determine what should be handled by NAT or QoS 
			On a router interface, determine if the traffic should be allowed in 
			Source IP, Destination IP, TCP/UDP port number, ICMP, etc. 
				Does it match the existing ACL? Decide whether to allow/deny 
			Can be used in an OS to allow/deny access to file system 
		MFA (Multifactor authentication) 
			Something you are, have, know.
			Something you do, somewhere you are 
			Separate hardware tokens, can be expensive 
		Email - Blocking unsolicited email
			Stop it at gateway before it reaches the user. Could be a server, a cloud 
			Scan and block malicious software
		Hard token - Something you have. Maybe a physical number generator. Expensive 
		Soft token - Authentication application. Pseudorandom number generator 
			Can't guess it, and it changes constantly 
			Saves money, no separate device to manage 
		SMS (Short message service) - Texts, but more than that 
			Login factor sent to SMS to predefined phone number 
			Issues exist through interception, spoofing, phone number is reassigned, etc. 
		Voice call - Phone call provides the token 
			Same problems as SMS 
		Authenticator application
	MDM (Mobile device management) - Manage company owned and BYOD devices 
		Centralized management of all devices 
		Set policies on apps, data, camera, etc. 
		Can be entire device or a partition 
		
	Active Directory - Database of everything on network. Foundation of corporate network 
		User, printers, groups, devices, computers
		Centralized authentication management 
		Centralized access control 
		Used by help desk - reset passwords, remove users, add users
		
		Login script - Automate a script after login. A series of tasks for a particular OU
			Always have a particular drive mapped, authomatically share a printer, etc. 
			Associate the script with a group policy 
			Create different scripts for different OUs 
		Domain - Name associated with a group of users and devices on a network 
			All the information is stored on a central database on domain 
			Access the database through Active Directory
			Central point for troubleshooting or information about the network 
			
		Group policy/ updates - Manage computers and users 
			Local and Domain policies 
			Central console for login scripts, Network configurations, security
			gpupdate - update a client if it doesn't require a restart 
				gpupdate /force - update ALL policies for the user, not just new things 
		Organizational units (OU) - keep the very large database organized 
			All users in one OU, or create separate departments. 
				Separate OU for buildings, regions, etc. 
			Apply policies to certain OUs 
			
		Home folder - A user Home folder is assigned to a network folder 
			Manage and backup files from the network 
			Avoids storing files on the local computer 
			May require you to train employees, to get them to save on the network instead 
			
		Folder redirection
			Desktop, Downloads, Music, Documents, etc. 
				These folders are redirected to a server 
				Also some apps use the Windows Library folders 
			User configurations - policies - windows settings - folder redirection
			Offline files - you're not always connected
				When you return to the network, the changes are updated 
				
		Security groups - create a group, specifiy permissions to the group, and then add users 
			Some are built in - user, guest, remote management, event log readers 
	
2.2 Compare and contrast wireless security protocols and authentication methods 
	Protocols and encryption
		WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2) 
			CCMP block cipher mode - block of data is encrypted and the entire block is sent 
				Data confidentiality with AES encyrption 
				MIC (Message integrity check) with CBC-MAC 
			PSK (Preshared key) for authentication 
				Hackers can listen in and brute force the key 
					Especially with increased GPU and cloud sharing capabilities 
		WPA3	
			GCMP block cipher mode (Galois CMP) - stronger encryption than WPA2
				Still using AES 
				MIC with GMAC 
			SAE (Simultaneous authentication of equals) - Changed from PSK
				Mutual authentication 
				Shared session key without sending the key across the network 
				Same PSK is still a different session key 
			
		TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) - encryption method, with WPA 
		AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - newer encryption solution starting with WPA2
	Authentication
		RADIUS - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service 
			A common protocol, wide variety of platforms and devices 
			AAA (Authentication, Authorization, accounting) protocol 
			Centralized authentication for users 
				One source for routers, switches, all other network access 
		TACACS+ - Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System
			Remote authentication protocol 
			+ is the latest version 
		Kerberos - Network authentication protocol 
			SSO - login once with credentials
				When you login, you get a "ticket" that you show to other servers 
		Multifactor (MFA, 2FA) - more expensive but more secure 
			On the other hand, apps are inexpensive 
2.3 Given a scenario, detect, remove, and prevent malware using the appropriate tools and methods 
	Malware - malicious software that can gather infromation, coordinate together, show advertising, 
	Delete data, encrpt data, etc. 
	It takes advantage of a vulnerability, installs more malware, maybe even a bot 
	This weakest link can be the user. Email links, a pop-up, drive by download, or worm 
		Trojan - Software that pretends to be something else 
			Circumvents existing security, but anti-virus may catch it
			Once inside, it can do stuff. Even open gates for other viruses 
		Rootkit - Originally a Unix technique, "root" 
			Modifies core system files, part of the kernel 
			Can be invisible to the OS, so task manager wont see it etc. 
			Also invisibile to traditional anti-virus software 
			
			Look for unusual or out of place things, use a specific remover utility
			Secure boot will check this 
		Virus - malware that reproduces itself. Can spread through file systems and the network. 
			May or may not cause problems; some are invisible, others can be annoying 
			Anti-virus is good, but theres thousands of new viruses every week 
				Which is why you keep the signature updated 
		Spyware - malware that spies on you. Advertising, identity theft, fraud 
			Can trick you into installing, P2P, fake security software, etc. 
			Keyloggers - capture every keystroke and send it to the hacker
		Ransomware - locks your data until you pay
			Pay the hacker, they give you the decryption key
			Or delete everything, restore from a backup 
		Keylogger - Passwords, email messages, web site URLS, all of it is saved and sent
			Circumvents encryption, since the keylogger has alread caught it 
			Also clipboard, screen, instant messaging, search engine 
		Boot sector virus - Some boot loaders can be modified to run malware 
			Every time you start the system it runs, antivirus can't see it
			Even after removing it, next time it reboots itself. 
			But UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot blocks it 
		Cryptominers - attackers use your CPU to mine. 
			Maybe you visit an infected website, or its installed and always mining 
	Tools and methods
		Recovery mode - Windows Recovery Environmant 
			You start a command line without starting the OS 
			Gives you access to all the files, so its dangerous. Last resort 
			Does give complete control to remove stuff 
			Advanced startup from the OS, or hold shift while pressing restart 
		Anti-malware and antivirus - often together 
			On demand scan when you tell it to
			Real time is better, always scanning 
			Modern software even recognizes malicious activity instead of just a signature 
		Software firewalls - Monitor the local computer
			Will alert for unknown or unauthorized communication 
			Microsoft Defender Firewall is default, and a bare minimum 
		Anti-phishing training - No technology stops a user 
			Train and test the users. Find out who's a weak link, train again 
		User education regarding common threats 
			One on one personal training, posters, message board, login messages, intranet page 
		OS reinstallation - Only one way to guarantee malware removal 
			Restore from backup is fast, but as long as its not already infected 
			Manual installtion is more thorough
			Companies may image your entire OS, so a user can just restore from there 
2.4 Explain common social-engineering attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities 
	Social Engineering - constantly changing
		Phishing - Pretending to be someone you know, can trust 
			Email, text, etc. - Check the URL 
			Usually there's not something right with the website - its off 
		Vishing - Voice phishing 
			Caller ID is spoofed 
			Could be fake security check, or bank needing information, etc. 
		Spear fishing - targeted phising with insider information 
			More believable attack 
			Whaling - spear phishing the CEO 
		Shoulder surfing - Just looking at someones screen 
			Curiosity, espionage, competitive advantage 
			Surprisingly easy - airports, planes, hallway facing monitors 
			Surf from afar - binoculars, telescopes, webcam monitoring
			
			Control your input. Check your surroundings, position yourself well 
				Privacy filters, so people next to you can't see 
				Keep your monitor out of sight 
		Tailgating - using an authorized person to gain access to building. No consent 
			Piggybacking - authorized person is giving uninformed consent 
			Have a policy for visitors 
			Identify everyone inside - don't be afraid to ask 
			One scan, one person 
			Access control vestibule / airlock - more extreme 
		Impersonation - Pretend to be someone else to gain access 
			Using information from trash, internet, etc. to be believable 
			Attack the victim as someone higher in rank 
			Use technical details to confuse user 
			Be friendly to ensnare them better 
		Dumpster diving - Important information is thrown out 
			Details can be used for an attack 
			Trash timing is important 
		Evil twin - Looks like a legitimate access point 
			Maybe same SSID, logo, etc. 
			May even be able to overwhelm the legit AP
			WiFi hotspots are easy to fool 
			Encrypt everything - HTTPS AND VPN 
	Threats
	
		DoS(Denial of service) - Force a service to fail
			Causes a system to be unavailable - maybe even a competitor 
			Or creates a smokescreen to gain access to somethign else 
			Doesn't have to be overloading a server - turn the power off for the bulding 
				Can be unintentional, "friendly" DoS 
				Limited bandwidth and someone is trying to download something big, etc. 
		DDoS(Distributed denial of service) - An army of computers for DoS 
			Harder to go through all the computers 
			Can be international, or maybe a botnet for a coordinated attack 
			People have no idea their participating 
			
			Filter out traffice patterns 
			Anti-DDoS systems, third party technolgy, etc. 
		Zero-day attack - OS and apps have vulnerabilities that aren't found yet 
			Someone is always trying to find them - good guys and bad 
			zero-day means the attack is on a vulnerability that was previously unknown 
			CVE (Common vulnerabilities and exposures) - a database 
		Spoofing (ARP poisoning) - every device has an ARP cache 
			a list of all the IP addresses and MAC addresses associated with then 
			Cache is empty on startup, and then you start populating it as you connect to devices 
			Device sends out an ARP (Address resolution protocol) to figure out who the router is 
			Attacker responds with their own MAC address, and claims to be the IP of the router 
				So then the device updates its ARP cache with the attacker's MAC address 
				Everything the device sends out is sent to the attacker instead 
			Attacker also poisons the router, claiming to be the device 
				So now its sitting in the middle of the conversation 
		On-path attack - Attacker sits in the middle of a conversation and listens or modifies it 
			"man in the middle attack" 
			They redirect your traffic without you knowing, and then pass it to the original destination 
			ARP poisoning - ARP has no security, they take advantage of that 
			On-path browser attack - middleman is inside the browser you're using 
				So you don't need access to their network or subnet
				Just install malware on the device
				Huge advantage for the attacker, you get stuff before its encrypted 
				Malware then listens, waiting for you to login to your bank or something 
		Brute-force attack - can't undo a hashing process to recover the password 
			So you try every possible password to see if it matches the hash 
			Takes a long time, and power. Stronger hashing algorithm slows this time down 
			Trying this online is hard, very slow, and failed login usually locks the account 
			Instead, they do it offline 
				Obtain list of users and hashes 
				Calculate password hash, compare it to stored hash
				Lot of CPU resources and time 
		Dictionary attack - Use a dictionary to find common words 
			Faster than brute force 
			Many common wordlists available, so they hope you used real words for the password 
			Some of these wordlists are customized by language, line of work, etc. 
			They can also substitute letters - p&ssw0rd, they'll try it 
			Still takes a lot of time and resources 
			Limited by a dictionary - can't guess random character passwords 
		Insider threat - more than just leaving password on sticky note 
			Some insiders are just up to no good 
			Even if the insider doesn't have any special access, they have institutional knowledge 
				Insiders know what to hit 
			Extensive time and resources, studying vulnerabilities, etc. 
			Attackers can also recruit insiders 
				Randomware, offering Bitcoin in exchange for access 
				One randsomware attack can give millions to the attacker - the bribe is just change 
			Stay aware, have good backups 
		SQL (Structured Query Language) injection 
			Code injection - adding your own information into a data stream 
				This shouldn't happen with good programming 
			HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, etc. injections 
			SQL injection - modify requests, provide you with information you dont normally have access to
			If you manipulate the database, you control everything 
			Make sure any software is not susceptible to a SQL injection 
		XSS (Cross-site scripting) - information from one site shared with another 
			Usually because of browser security vulnerabilities
				Update your browser 
			Code should be able to stop this, but there can be errors 
			Reflected XSS - Run a script inside the users browser 
				Could be like a link in an email. Clicking runs a script 
				Executes in a browser as if it came from the server, but with hacked script
				Gain information, access, etc 
			Persistent (stored) XSS attack
				Post message to social network. Comment with a code. 
				Persistent because everyone gets it
				No specific target, or all viewers to the page
				
			Be careful when clicking links. Consider disabling JavaScript - may break websites 
			Keep browsers and apps updated 
			Developors should check their code 
	Vulnerabilities 
		Non-compliant systems - constant changes and updates. If a computer is off for 3 months, etc. 
			SOE (Standard operating environment) approved hardware/software systems 
				standard operation system image. Constantly updated. 
			Need pathces, signatures, anti virus to be compliant. Or you can't access. 
			Monitor application traffic, checking for unapproved apps.
			Periodic scans to check for patches 
		Unpatched systems - updates are automated after approval from IT
			One forgotten system can be the weak link - happens a lot 
			
		Unprotected systems (Missing antivirus, firewall)
			Security issues are roadblocks. Troubleshooting itself is insecure. 
			
		EOL OSs - security patches past selling the OS 
			EOSL - stops selling and supporting 
				Or a premium support option 
				significant concern 
		BYOD (Bring your own device) - Employee owns the degice, but also used for company. 
			So both personal and corporate data on the device 
			MDM is important. And makes sure it meets company requirements for securiy
			Selling the device, if it catches a virus, etc. 
2.5 Given a scenario, manage and configure basic security settings in the Windows OS 
	Defender Antivirus - realtime 
		Activate/deactivate - should only be for temporary trouleshooting 
			Increases risk. Take 5 
		Updated definitions - antivirus is only as good as updated signatures 
			Automatically or manually 
	Firewall - should always be enabled 
		Activate/deactivate - troubleshooting with elevated permissions 
			Can also turn it off in only parts of the network 
			You can also block ALL connections
		Port security - block or allow. Incoming or outcoming. 
		Application security - knows all your applications, can disable them from here 
			Custom rules, allowing only specific apps, etc. 
			
	Users and groups 
		Local vs Microsoft account 
			Local - login to only that specific device 
			Microsoft - login to local, or to other technologies like onedrive 
			
		Standard account 
		Administrator - super user 
		Guest user 
		Power user - not much more than normal user 
	Login OS options 
		Username and password 
		PIN 
		Fingerprint 
		Facial recognition
		SSO
	NTFS vs share permissions 
		File and folder attributes - security tab can sepcify permissions 
		Share permissions is for access for others in the network 
		The most restricted permission wins 
		inheritance - permissions are inherited from the parent
			Unless you move it to a diffent folder on the same volume 
		Explicit permissions are specified. Explicit takes precendence 
	Run as administrator vs standard user 
		UAC (User account control) - limit software access 
			Changing you password, using the network
			Admins may see it for installing, Remote desktop, etc. 
			Secure Desktop - the screen explaining the consequences 
	BitLocker - encrypt entire volume 
	BitLocker To Go - encrypt USB flash drives 
	EFS (Encrypting File System) - encrypt files and folders 
		Requires NTFS 
		Not supported for Home 
2.6 Given a scenario, configure a workstation to meet best practices for security
	Data-at-rest encryption - FDE
		As opposed to file system encryption
		Useful to encrypt removable media as well 
		Managing the key is critical 
			Have a copy of the key, keep it handy 
			May be integrated into Active Directory
	Password best practices
		Complexity requirements - resist guessing and brute force 
			Increase password entropy
			Length - at least 8 characters 
			Character types 
		Expiration requirements - all should expire after some time, automatically 
			System remembers password history and requires unique passwords 
			Critical systems maybe even more frequent changes 
			Recovery process should be clear and secure 
		Change default username and password always - databases of them exist that can be used 
		BIOS/UEFI passwords -
			Admin password is required to make changes to BIOS 
			user password can prevent booting 
	End-user best practices 
		Use screensaver locks - enforce administratively, integrate with login credentials 
		Log off when not in use 
		Secure/protect critical hardware - locking hardware 
		Secure PII (Persnonally identifiable information) and passwords 
			Name, address, SSN, etc 
			Control your input, aware of your surroundings
			Privacy filters, keep monitor out of sight 
	Account management 
		Restrict user permissions - not everyone is an admin 
			rights based on groups 
		Restrict login times - limit access to certain times of day 
		Disable guest account - all OSs include these extra accounts 
			disable or remove them, and the guest accounts 
			Disable interactive login - they can still work in the background, but nobody can login 
			Change default username/passwords 
		Use failed attempts lockout - prevents brute force attacks
		Use timeout/screen lock - timing or even when you walk away 
	Change default administrator's user account/password 
	Disable AutoRun - executes when you plug in something 
		Windows 7 and forth disabled this 
	Disable AutoPlay - Choose the default option when something is plugged in 
		Best to disable this as well 
2.7 Explain common methods for securing mobile and embedded devices 
	Screen locks - restrict access to device 
		Facial recognition 
		PIN codes 
		Fingerprint
		Pattern 
		Swipe 
	Remote wipes 
	Locator applications 
		Built in GPS. Find phone on a map. Control from afar 
			Make a sound, display a message 
			Wipe everything from a distance 
	OS updates - Don't get behind, its a security concern 
	Device encryption 
		iOS 8 and later is encrypted with you passcode 
		Android 5 and later is also encrypted by default 
	Remote backup applications - Difficult to backup somehting always moving 
		On going backup just constantly does it
		Without wires, using the network. The cloud 
		Restore device easily if lost or damaged 
	Failed login attempts restrictions 
		iOS can erase everything after 10 attempts 
		Andriod will lock the device and ask for Google credentials
			Else it wipes the phone 
	Antivirus/anti-malware 
		Apple iOS is a closed environment, so they try to find vulnerabilities
		Android is more open, apps coming from anywhere. Easier for attackers 
		Apps run in a sandbox inside the OS, dont have full access to data 
		Third party virus and malware protection 
	Firewalls - Mobile phones dont include a firewall 
		Apps are available, but none seem to be widely used 
		Enterprise environment can control mobile apps 
	Policies and procedures 
		BYOD vs corporate owned 
			MDM - mobile device manager configures policies on devices 
			For example, camera doesnt work at the lab
			Entire device vs "work partition" 
			Manage access control as well, to the device 
		Profile security requirements 
	IoT - sensors, smart devices, wearable technology
		All have weak defaults; they're not security professionals 
		Consider isolating IoT to their own network 
2.8 Given a scenario, use common data destruction and disposal methods 
	Physical destruction 
		Drilling - or hammer. quick and easy, all the way through the platters or chips 
		Shredding - heavy machinery. complete destruction 
		Degaussing - electromagnetic. Remove the field, destroyinf data and electronics 
		Incinerating 
	Recycling or repurposing best practices 
		Erasing/wiping - file level overwriting 
			sdelete - overwrite information but keep the rest of the drive intact 
			Third party services to delete the whole drive 
		Low-level formatting - done at the factory, we cant do it 
		Standard formatting - quick format removes the drive index, but leaves the data 
			Regular format overwrites all data with 0. no way to retrieve 
	Outsourcing concepts 
		Third party vendor 
		Certificate of destruction/recycling - confirmation that the data was destroyed 
			Paper trail of broken data 
2.9 Given a scenario, configure appropriate security settings on SOHO wireless and wired networks 
	Home router settings 
		Change default passwords - the right credentials can provide full control 
		Firmware updates - provided by manufacturer
			Closes architecture , proprietary 
			Updates can be bugs, features, security. Install the latest 
		Content filtering
			Control traffic based on data withing the content 
			Corporate control of outbound and inbound data 
			NSFW, parental controls, protection from malware 
		IP filtering 
			Allow list - nothing passes unless approved 
			Deny list - everything is allowed except the denied list 
		Physical placement/secure locations - often a single device 
			Router, swtich, AP, firewall 
			Location may be in a secure room. APs will be in universal location 
			Plan before installation
		DHCP reservations 
			Some networks statically assign things instead of using DHCP 
				Not a securiy technique - only obscurity 
			DHCP makes it easy - changes in one place that get transferred to all devices 
			Reservation - To make sure a device has the same IP address each time
				Table of MAC addresses matching an IP address
		Static WAN IP - usually dynamically allocated 
			Easier to manage if the IP address is static 
			Coordinate with ISP so you have the same address for your internet connection 
			Could be an additional cost 
		UPnP - network devices automatically configure itself and find other network devices 
			Zero configuration 
			An app with UPnP will communicate with router and tell it to configure a port forward 
			Best practice is to disable it
			If necessary, better to use a screened subnet 
		Screened subnet - DMZ 
			Section of the network on the firewall that's not connected to the internal network 
			Public access to public resources 
	Wireless specific 
		Changing the SSID (Service set identifier) - sometimes very generic, from which people 	
			can look up the device, and find vulnerabilities
		Disabling SSID broadcast - obscurity measure. Can be found anyway through network analysis 
		Encryption settings - 
			Open system - no authentication, no encryption 
		Disabling guess access - No access to internal private network 
			Can still be encrypted 
			Often enabled by default 
			Can use it instead for lab, IoT, etc. 
		Changing channels - find an open frequency to minimize interference 
	Firewall settings 
		Disabling unused ports - administratively disable ports from inside 
		NAC (Network access control) - requires authentication before anyone can communicate 
			So even if there's an open enable physical port, no access 
		Port forwarding/mapping - inbound traffic to SOHO router is rerouted to internal resource 
			External IP/port number mapped to internal IP/port number 
			AKA Destination NAT or Static NAT 
			Does no expire until you turn it off administratively
2.10 Given a scenario, install and configure browsers and relevant security settings 
	Browser download/installation 
		Trusted sources - Avoid 3rd party sites
			Dont click links in emails, dont follow links to other websites 
				Visit a browser directly always 
			Hashing - Comfirm the downloaded file matches with the live server 
				The file you installed matches the file on the server exactly 
				Install hash checking application 
				Available for GUI and command line - options in microsoft store 
		Untrusted sources 
	Extensions and plug-ins
		Trusted sources - official browser extension library, chrome store, known websites, etc. 
		untrusted sources - random or unfamiliar websites
		Dont trust any software, and always have backups 
	Password managers - all credentials in one location 
		Credentials are encrypted and cloud synchronized 
		Create unique passwords that you dont have to remember 
		Some for corporate use 
	Secure connections/sites - valid certificates 
		Itll give you a message if something isnt right 
		Look at certificate details
			Domain name is expired or wrong, not signed or signed by someone untrusted, 
			date and time is wrong, etc. 
	Settings 
		Pop-up blocker - prevent unwanted notifcation windows 
			Should stay enabled, disable for troubleshooting 
			You can block and enable for certain websites 
		Clearing browser data 
			History, downloads, passwords, etc. 
		Clearing cache 
			Parts of a website are stored locally - removes all of that 
		Private browsing mode - limits gathered information 
			Doesnt store information from a browsing session 
			Good for privacy and troubleshooting 
			Removes information when browser is closed 
		Sign-in/browser data synchronization 
			Share browsing data across multiple systems by signing in 
			Computers, mobile devices, tablets, etc. 
			History, bookmarks, extensions, etc.  
		Ad blockers 
			Many sites will track visits and recognize a return visit 
			Diffcult to always recognize an ad, you can control the security level
