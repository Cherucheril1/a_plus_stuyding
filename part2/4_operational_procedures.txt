4.1 Given a scenario, implement best practices associated with documentation and support systems 
information management 
	Ticketing systems 
		User information
			Name, usually integrated into Active Directory etc 
			Can be automatic, if issues arrive through portal, gateway, etc. 
			Confirm contact information
		Device information 
		Description of problems
			clear and concise 
			One of the most important - decides next step, who gets assigned it, etc. 
		Categories
			Password issues, change request, etc. Broad descriptions 
		Severity 
			Established set of standards - low, medium, critical, etc. 
		Escalation levels
			Escalate to new tier or a specific group 
		Clear, concise written communication 
			Problem description 
			Progress notes
				Many people may be working on a single ticket 
				Document any changes, addition information, concise progress, etc. 
			Problem resolution
				Document the solution, may be referenced later 
	Asset management - record of every asset 
		Inventory lists - central asset tracking system 
		Database system
		Asset tags and IDs
		Procurement life cycle - purchasing policy 
			Starts with request, inluding budgeting information and approvals 
			Negotiate with supplies, terms and conditions 
			Purchase, invoice, and payment 
		Warranty and licensing - Different process if out of warranty 
			Software costs, ongoing renewal deadlines, etc 
		Assigned users - associate a person with an asset
	Types of documents 
		AUP (Acceptable use policy) - detailed documentation. May be part of rules of behaviour 
			Internet use, telephones, computers, mobile devices 
			Used to limit legal liability of organization 
		Network topology diagram - describes network layout 
			Could be a logical diagram 
			Could show physical rack locations 
		Regulatory compliance requirements 
			Catalog of rules across many aspects of business or life 
			Could be industry specific or situational 
			Penalties - fines, loss of employement, jail 
			Scope - domestic vs international 
			Splash screens - message, logo, graphic shown on startup or login 
				Can be informational, can be used for branding 
				Could be a legal or adminstrative message about how to rely data, etc. 
		Incident reports
			Security policy 
			Ongoing incidents, reports, documentation 
		SOPs 
			Procedures for custom installation of software package 
				Testing and change control 
			Documentation is key, everyone can read and review 
		New user setup checklist (on boarding) 
			IT agreements, could be part of employee handbook or AUP 
			Create accounts and groups 
			Provide required hardware, configured 
		End user termination checklist (off boarding)
			Should be predefined 
			What happens to hardware? data? 
			Deactivate account information 
	Knowledge base/articles 
		External sources - manifacturer, developer, internet community
		internal documentation - institutional knowledge. Could be part of help desk software 
		Find solution quickly, search database 
		
4.2 Explain basic change-management best practices
		Change management is a most common risk, often overlooked 
		Have clear policies. Could be difficult to start implementing one 
	Documented business processes
		Rollback plan - Go back to previous configuration, revert your changes 
			Not that easy, some changes are involved 
			Always have backups 
		Sandbox texting - isolated testing environment 
			No impact on rest of organization, technological safe space 
			Use before making a change to production. Test and confirm before deployment 
			Confirm rollback plan 
		Responsible staff member 
			IT team implements change
			Business customer is the user of the technology, that wants the change 
			Organization sponser is responsible financially, to pay or profit 
	Change management - formal process for managing change to avoid problems 
		Request forms - could be online
			Easy to manage, nothing is missed, create detailed reports
			Transparent process, many groups are involved 
		Purpose of the change 
			Application upgrades, new features, bug fixes, performance enhancement, security 
			Changes are costly, should be a good reason 
		Scope of the change - limited to single server or entire site? etc. 
		Data and time of the change - could be a few minutes, or hours. Impact on business 
		Affected systems/impact 
		risk analysis 
			risk level for changing, or NOT changing 
		change board approvals - last step, actual work next 
		End user acceptance - was it successful? 
			Ideally just a formality - they should be involved the whole time 
4.3 Given a scenario, implement workstation backup and recovery methods 
	Backup and recovery 
		Full - backup everything, all OS and user files 
			Longest backup process, might be impractical every day. Lots of space needed 
		Incremental - full backup taken first, next backup contains changes 
			But the next one is only the changes since the last one
			Restoration needs full backup and all the incremental backups 
		Differential - Full backup taken first, next backups only have changes 
			Grows larger as data is changed, it "integrals" the changes 
			Restoration needs full backup and last differential 
		Synthetic - create a full backup without actually performing a full backup 
			First full backup copies every file 
			Subsequent incremental backups are added altogether into a synthetic full backup 
			Advantage of full backup, efficiency of incremental backup 
			So synthetic comes from other backups, not a "real" full backup process 
	Backup testing - make sure it can be restored 
		Simulate a disaster situation and restore from backup 
		Confirm the restoration
		Frequency - ongoing basis - weekly, monthly, quarterly 
	Backup rotation schemes
		On site vs off site 
			On site - no internet link required, data is immediately available. Less expensive 
			off site - transfer data over internet or WAN. Data is available after disaster, restoration 
				from anywhere 
			Organizations use both - more copies, more options 
		GFS (Grandfather-father-son) - 3 backup rotations 
			Monthly, weekly, daily 
			12 monthly full backups (grandfather)
			4/5 weekly full backups (father) 
			31 daily backups (son)
		3-2-1 backup rule 
			3 copies always available - 1 primary and 2 backups 
			2 different types of media - local drive, tape, NAS, etc. 
			1 copy of the backup should be offsite 
				offsite storage, cloud backup 
4.4 Given a scenario, use common safety procedures 
		static electricity isnt harmful to computers - discharge is 
		High humidity over 60% can help, not practical 
		Ground with your hand, "self ground" - touched exposed metal before touching component 
			With POWER UNPLUGGED 
			Do not touch ground of an electrical system 
	ESD (Electrostatic discharge) straps 
		Connect your wrist to a metal part of the computer
		ESD pad - workspace for the computer that is also connected to metal 
	ESD mats - standing or sitting, also connected to metal 
	Equipment grounding - most computer products connect to ground 
		Equipment racks will have a large ground wire
		Dont remove ground connection, its to protect you 
		And never connect yourself to the ground, you can be shocked 
	Proper power handling 
	Proper component handling and storage 
		Try not to touch componenets directly, card edges only 
		Store in HVAC regulated environment 
		Avoid high humidity, silica gel packets can help 
		Store in original padded box, or bubble wrap
	Antistatic bags - safely move or ship components 
		Also put newly purchased stuff in a bag 
	Compliance with government regulations 
		Health and safety laws, varying widely depending on location
		Building codes, fire prevention, electrical codes
		Environmental regulation, high tech waste disposal 
	Personal safety 
		Disconnect power before repairing PC - dont touch anything if youre not sure 
			Don't repair internals of a power supply - just replace the whole thing 
		Lifting techniques - lift with legs, back straight 
			Dont carry overweight items, and get equipment to help lift 
		Electrical fire safety - dont use water or foam 
			Use carbon dioxide, FM-200, other dry chemicals 
			Remove the power source if accessible. Or go to breaker 
		Safety goggles - chemicals, printer repair, toner, batteries 
		Air filtration mask - dusty computers, printer toner 
4.5 Summarize environmental impacts and loacl environmental controls 
	MSDS/documentation for handling and disposal - abbreviated as SDS 
		Proper battery disposal - dispose at local hazardous waste facility 
		Proper toner disposal - recycle and reuse, manufacturers may provide return box 
			Some supply companies will offer a discount for each cartridge 
		Proper disposal of other devices and assets - refer to SDS, dont just throw it away 
	Temperature, humidity level awareness, and proper ventilation 
		High humidity causes condensation, low causes static discharges 
		Devices and people need constant cooling, ventilation is important 
		Location/equipment placement 
		Dust cleanup
		Compressed air/vacuums
	Power surges, under voltage events, and power failures 
		UPS - Uninterruptible power supply - always available, even if you lose main power 
			Standby UPS - always connected to main power, and then it moves over to battery backup
			Line-interactive UPS - always connected to main power, but also to battery, easier transitiion
			On-line UPS - always connected to battery, no switching needed 
		Battery backup
		Surge suppressor - storms, power grid changes, power spike, noise, etc. 
			Filters out all that stuff, spikes diverted to ground 
			Noise filters remove line noise 
			Specs 
				Joule ratings - amount of surge absorption 
				Surge amp ratings 
				Voltage let through ratings - how much voltage is let through during spike 
4.6 Explain the importance of prohibited content/activity and privacy, licensing, and policy concepts 
	Incident response
		Chain of custody - control evidence, maintain integrity 
			Everyone who contacts evidence 
			Avoid tampering, maybe hashes 
			Label and catalog everything, digital signatures, seal and store
		First response - Identifies issue, logs, in person, monitoring data, etc. 
			Can mitigate and limit scope of event 
			Report to proper channels, dont delay 
			Collect and protect information 
		Inform management/law enforcement as necessary
		Copy of drive (data integrity and preservation)
			Copy not just files, but bit-for-bit
			Remove the physical drive, use hardware write-blocker to preserve data 
			Software imaging tools, or hardware copying 
			Hashes for data integrity - you can see if its been altered 
		Documentation of incident 
			Internal ise and legal proceedings 
			Summary information, overview of event 
			Detailed explanation of data acquisition
			The findings 
			Conclusion 
	Licensing/DRM (digital rights management)/EULA (end user license agreement)
		Terms and conditions, overall use, how many copies, backup options
		Valid licenses 
			Per seat - x people you can handle software to, only they can use it 
			Concurrent - x licenses can be used at the same time, can be different people 
		Non-expired licenses 
			Ongoing subscriptions, annual, 3 year, etc. until expiration date 
		Personal use license vs corporate use license 
			Personal - home user, usually with a single device 
				Or group of devices by that person. 1 time purchase 
			Corporate - per-seat or site license 
				Software can be installed anywhere. Has renewals 
		Open source license 
			FOSS (Free and Open Source) - source code is freely available 
				You can compile your own executable 
			Closed source/commerical - Code is private, you get a compiled executable 
			EULA - determine how the software can be used 
	Regulated data
		Credit card transactions - PCI DSS - standard for protecting credit cards 
			6 control objectives 
				Build and maintain a secure network systems 
				Protect cardholder data 
				Maintain a vulnerability management program 
				Implement strong access control measures 
				Regularly monitor and test networks 
				Maintain an information security policy 
		Personal government issued information
		PII
		Healthcare data 
		Data retention requirements 
4.7 Given a scenario, use proper communication techniques and professionalism 
	Professional appearance and attire 
	Use proper language and avoid jargon, acronyms, and slang when applicable 
	Maintain a positive attitude/project confidence 
	Actively listen, take notes, and avoid interrupting the customer 
	Be culturally sensitive 
	Be on time (if late, contact the customer)
	Avoid distractions 
	Dealing with difficult customers or situations
	Set and meet expectations/time line and communicate status with customers
	Deal appropriately with customers' confidential and private materials
