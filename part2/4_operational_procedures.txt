4.1 Given a scenario, implement best practices associated with documentation and support systems 
information management 
	Ticketing systems 
		User information
			Name, usually integrated into Active Directory etc 
			Can be automatic, if issues arrive through portal, gateway, etc. 
			Confirm contact information
		Device information 
		Description of problems
			clear and concise 
			One of the most important - decides next step, who gets assigned it, etc. 
		Categories
			Password issues, change request, etc. Broad descriptions 
		Severity 
			Established set of standards - low, medium, critical, etc. 
		Escalation levels
			Escalate to new tier or a specific group 
		Clear, concise written communication 
			Problem description 
			Progress notes
				Many people may be working on a single ticket 
				Document any changes, addition information, concise progress, etc. 
			Problem resolution
				Document the solution, may be referenced later 
	Asset management - record of every asset 
		Inventory lists - central asset tracking system 
		Database system
		Asset tags and IDs
		Procurement life cycle - purchasing policy 
			Starts with request, inluding budgeting information and approvals 
			Negotiate with supplies, terms and conditions 
			Purchase, invoice, and payment 
		Warranty and licensing - Different process if out of warranty 
			Software costs, ongoing renewal deadlines, etc 
		Assigned users - associate a person with an asset
	Types of documents 
		AUP (Acceptable use policy) - detailed documentation. May be part of rules of behaviour 
			Internet use, telephones, computers, mobile devices 
			Used to limit legal liability of organization 
		Network topology diagram - describes network layout 
			Could be a logical diagram 
			Could show physical rack locations 
		Regulatory compliance requirements 
			Catalog of rules across many aspects of business or life 
			Could be industry specific or situational 
			Penalties - fines, loss of employement, jail 
			Scope - domestic vs international 
			Splash screens - message, logo, graphic shown on startup or login 
				Can be informational, can be used for branding 
				Could be a legal or adminstrative message about how to rely data, etc. 
		Incident reports
			Security policy 
			Ongoing incidents, reports, documentation 
		SOPs 
			Procedures for custom installation of software package 
				Testing and change control 
			Documentation is key, everyone can read and review 
		New user setup checklist (on boarding) 
			IT agreements, could be part of employee handbook or AUP 
			Create accounts and groups 
			Provide required hardware, configured 
		End user termination checklist (off boarding)
			Should be predefined 
			What happens to hardware? data? 
			Deactivate account information 
	Knowledge base/articles 
		External sources - manifacturer, developer, internet community
		internal documentation - institutional knowledge. Could be part of help desk software 
		Find solution quickly, search database 
		
4.2 Explain basic change-management best practices
		Change management is a most common risk, often overlooked 
		Have clear policies. Could be difficult to start implementing one 
	Documented business processes
		Rollback plan - Go back to previous configuration, revert your changes 
			Not that easy, some changes are involved 
			Always have backups 
		Sandbox texting - isolated testing environment 
			No impact on rest of organization, technological safe space 
			Use before making a change to production. Test and confirm before deployment 
			Confirm rollback plan 
		Responsible staff member 
			IT team implements change
			Business customer is the user of the technology, that wants the change 
			Organization sponser is responsible financially, to pay or profit 
	Change management - formal process for managing change to avoid problems 
		Request forms - could be online
			Easy to manage, nothing is missed, create detailed reports
			Transparent process, many groups are involved 
		Purpose of the change 
			Application upgrades, new features, bug fixes, performance enhancement, security 
			Changes are costly, should be a good reason 
		Scope of the change - limited to single server or entire site? etc. 
		Data and time of the change - could be a few minutes, or hours. Impact on business 
		Affected systems/impact 
		risk analysis 
			risk level for changing, or NOT changing 
		change board approvals - last step, actual work next 
		End user acceptance - was it successful? 
			Ideally just a formality - they should be involved the whole time 
4.3 Given a scenario, implement workstation backup and recovery methods 
	Backup and recovery 
		Full - backup everything, all OS and user files 
			Longest backup process, might be impractical every day. Lots of space needed 
		Incremental - full backup taken first, next backup contains changes 
			But the next one is only the changes since the last one
			Restoration needs full backup and all the incremental backups 
		Differential - Full backup taken first, next backups only have changes 
			Grows larger as data is changed, it "integrals" the changes 
			Restoration needs full backup and last differential 
		Synthetic - create a full backup without actually performing a full backup 
			First full backup copies every file 
			Subsequent incremental backups are added altogether into a synthetic full backup 
			Advantage of full backup, efficiency of incremental backup 
			So synthetic comes from other backups, not a "real" full backup process 
	Backup testing - make sure it can be restored 
		Simulate a disaster situation and restore from backup 
		Confirm the restoration
		Frequency - ongoing basis - weekly, monthly, quarterly 
	Backup rotation schemes
		On site vs off site 
			On site - no internet link required, data is immediately available. Less expensive 
			off site - transfer data over internet or WAN. Data is available after disaster, restoration 
				from anywhere 
			Organizations use both - more copies, more options 
		GFS (Grandfather-father-son) - 3 backup rotations 
			Monthly, weekly, daily 
			12 monthly full backups (grandfather)
			4/5 weekly full backups (father) 
			31 daily backups (son)
		3-2-1 backup rule 
			3 copies always available - 1 primary and 2 backups 
			2 different types of media - local drive, tape, NAS, etc. 
			1 copy of the backup should be offsite 
				offsite storage, cloud backup 
4.4 Given a scenario, use common safety procedures 
		static electricity isnt harmful to computers - discharge is 
		High humidity over 60% can help, not practical 
		Ground with your hand, "self ground" - touched exposed metal before touching component 
			With POWER UNPLUGGED 
			Do not touch ground of an electrical system 
	ESD (Electrostatic discharge) straps 
		Connect your wrist to a metal part of the computer
		ESD pad - workspace for the computer that is also connected to metal 
	ESD mats - standing or sitting, also connected to metal 
	Equipment grounding - most computer products connect to ground 
		Equipment racks will have a large ground wire
		Dont remove ground connection, its to protect you 
		And never connect yourself to the ground, you can be shocked 
	Proper power handling 
	Proper component handling and storage 
		Try not to touch componenets directly, card edges only 
		Store in HVAC regulated environment 
		Avoid high humidity, silica gel packets can help 
		Store in original padded box, or bubble wrap
	Antistatic bags - safely move or ship components 
		Also put newly purchased stuff in a bag 
	Compliance with government regulations 
		Health and safety laws, varying widely depending on location
		Building codes, fire prevention, electrical codes
		Environmental regulation, high tech waste disposal 
	Personal safety 
		Disconnect power before repairing PC - dont touch anything if youre not sure 
			Don't repair internals of a power supply - just replace the whole thing 
		Lifting techniques - lift with legs, back straight 
			Dont carry overweight items, and get equipment to help lift 
		Electrical fire safety - dont use water or foam 
			Use carbon dioxide, FM-200, other dry chemicals 
			Remove the power source if accessible. Or go to breaker 
		Safety goggles - chemicals, printer repair, toner, batteries 
		Air filtration mask - dusty computers, printer toner 
4.5 Summarize environmental impacts and loacl environmental controls 
	MSDS/documentation for handling and disposal - abbreviated as SDS 
		Proper battery disposal - dispose at local hazardous waste facility 
		Proper toner disposal - recycle and reuse, manufacturers may provide return box 
			Some supply companies will offer a discount for each cartridge 
		Proper disposal of other devices and assets - refer to SDS, dont just throw it away 
	Temperature, humidity level awareness, and proper ventilation 
		High humidity causes condensation, low causes static discharges 
		Devices and people need constant cooling, ventilation is important 
		Location/equipment placement 
		Dust cleanup
		Compressed air/vacuums
	Power surges, under voltage events, and power failures 
		UPS - Uninterruptible power supply - always available, even if you lose main power 
			Standby UPS - always connected to main power, and then it moves over to battery backup
			Line-interactive UPS - always connected to main power, but also to battery, easier transitiion
			On-line UPS - always connected to battery, no switching needed 
		Battery backup
		Surge suppressor - storms, power grid changes, power spike, noise, etc. 
			Filters out all that stuff, spikes diverted to ground 
			Noise filters remove line noise 
			Specs 
				Joule ratings - amount of surge absorption 
				Surge amp ratings 
				Voltage let through ratings - how much voltage is let through during spike 
4.6 Explain the importance of prohibited content/activity and privacy, licensing, and policy concepts 
	Incident response
		Chain of custody - control evidence, maintain integrity 
			Everyone who contacts evidence 
			Avoid tampering, maybe hashes 
			Label and catalog everything, digital signatures, seal and store
		First response - Identifies issue, logs, in person, monitoring data, etc. 
			Can mitigate and limit scope of event 
			Report to proper channels, dont delay 
			Collect and protect information 
		Inform management/law enforcement as necessary
		Copy of drive (data integrity and preservation)
			Copy not just files, but bit-for-bit
			Remove the physical drive, use hardware write-blocker to preserve data 
			Software imaging tools, or hardware copying 
			Hashes for data integrity - you can see if its been altered 
		Documentation of incident 
			Internal ise and legal proceedings 
			Summary information, overview of event 
			Detailed explanation of data acquisition
			The findings 
			Conclusion 
	Licensing/DRM (digital rights management)/EULA (end user license agreement)
		Terms and conditions, overall use, how many copies, backup options
		Valid licenses 
			Per seat - x people you can handle software to, only they can use it 
			Concurrent - x licenses can be used at the same time, can be different people 
		Non-expired licenses 
			Ongoing subscriptions, annual, 3 year, etc. until expiration date 
		Personal use license vs corporate use license 
			Personal - home user, usually with a single device 
				Or group of devices by that person. 1 time purchase 
			Corporate - per-seat or site license 
				Software can be installed anywhere. Has renewals 
		Open source license 
			FOSS (Free and Open Source) - source code is freely available 
				You can compile your own executable 
			Closed source/commerical - Code is private, you get a compiled executable 
			EULA - determine how the software can be used 
	Regulated data
		Credit card transactions - PCI DSS - standard for protecting credit cards 
			6 control objectives 
				Build and maintain a secure network systems 
				Protect cardholder data 
				Maintain a vulnerability management program 
				Implement strong access control measures 
				Regularly monitor and test networks 
				Maintain an information security policy 
		Personal government issued information - used for government services and documentation 
			SSID, drivers license, etc. 
			There are restrictions on collecting or storing government information
		PII - any identifying information. Should be part of privacy policy 
			People dont realize the importance of this data, complacency 
			Attackers can use it to gain access or impersonate 
			GDPR (General data protection regulation) - EU regulation 
				Controls export of personal data, "right of erasure"
				Site privacy policy details rights for user 
		Healthcare data - PHI (protected health information)
			Shared between provided, so needs security requirements 
		Data retention requirements - keep files the change frequently for version control 
			Keep at least a week, but really more 
			Recovers from virus infection 
			There are legal requirements depending on data type 
4.7 Given a scenario, use proper communication techniques and professionalism 
	Professional appearance and attire 
		Match the required attire of the given environment
			Formal - may be specific requirements 
			Business casual - more relaxed 
			Youll eventually find the right balance. Look at management 
	Use proper language and avoid jargon, acronyms, and slang when applicable 
		Be the translator instead of confusing them more
		Communicate in terms that everyone can understand 
			Puts them at ease 
		Decisions are based on what you say 
	Maintain a positive attitude/project confidence 
		Positive tone of voice, partner with your customer 
		Problems cant always be fixed - do your best, provide helpful options 
		Attitude has a direct impact on customer experience 
	Actively listen, take notes, and avoid interrupting the customer 
		Even if you know the answer
		Build a relationship with customer, dont miss information 
		Notes to look back on later
		Especiall on phone, listen first, fully 
	Be culturally sensitive 
		Use appropriate professional titles, when applicable 
		Youre a teacher, not a warden - no insults or judgement
	Be on time (if late, contact the customer)
	Avoid distractions 
		Personal calls 
		Texting/social media 
		Personal interrptions 
		Talking to coworkers 
		Apologize for delays and unintended distractions 
		Create an environment for conversation 
			In person, open and inviting, candy bowl 
			On the phone, quite background, clear audio, stay off speakerphone 
	Dealing with difficult customers or situations
		Problems can be stressful - try not to add to it 
		Do not argue with customers or be defensive 
		Avoid dismissing customer problems 
		Avoid being judgemental 
		Make them smarter
		Youll make big mistakes, remember that and remember them 
		Clarify customer statements (ask open ended questions to narrow the scope of the problem, 
			restate the issue, or question to verify understanding)
			Keep an open mind, even if it seem obvious 
		Do not disclose experience via social media outlets 
	Set and meet expectations/time line and communicate status with customers
		Offer repair/replacement options, as needed 
		Provide proper documentation on the services provided 
			No room for questions 
		Follow up with customer/user at a later data to verify satisfaction 
			Keep everyone informed, even if status is unchanged 
	Deal appropriately with customers' confidential and private materials 
		Located on a computer, desktop, printer, etc. 
		Professional and private information, treat it with respect, how you want to be treated 
4.8 Identify the basics of scripting 
	Script file types 
		.bat - batch file: scripting for Windows at command line 
		.ps1 - PowerShell: command line for system administrators 
			Included with Windows 10 and 11 
			Almost every aspect of Windows is accessible through commands in PowerShell
			cmdlets (command-lets), executables, etc. 
			Manage services, configure active directory, etc. 
		.vbs - VBScript (visual basic scripting)
			general purpose scripting 
				Back end web server, scripting on Windows desktop, inside Office applications 
		.sh - shell script, basically a batch file for Unix/Linux
			Starts with #!, a sheband, or hashbang
		.js - JavaScript, scripting inside a browser
			Interactivity with HTML and CSS, almost every website has JS 
			JavaScript is not Java, different developers, origins, use, etc. 
		.py - Python, general purpose scripting 
			Broad appeal and support, especially because of cloud stuff 
			Runs across many different OSs 
	Use cases for scripting
		Basic automation - you dont have to be there, monitor and resolve problems before they happen 
			Fast, as fast as the computer
				No typing or delays, no human error 
				Automate mundane tasks so you can do something else 
		Restarting machines - restarting, app updates, security patches, etc. 
			Troubleshooting restarting, one a day restart 
		Remapping network drives - common task during startup
			Automate software changes, add or move user data, backup, etc. 
		Installation of applications - Install automatically 
			Youre not taking a flash drive to every device 
			Start installation with predefined answers 
			Map the installation drive, install without user input, disconnect map drive, 
				restart the system, all of that automatically 
		Automated backups - at night or off hours. 
			Saves a lot of time 
		Gathering of information/data - get specific information from remote device 
			Monitor performance, inventory management, hard/software configuration 
			Security and vulnerability tests 
		Initiating updates - OS, apps, drivers, etc. always changing 
	Other considerations when using scripts 
		Unintentionally introducing malware - make sure you know what youre installing 
		Inadvertently changing system settings - Test all updates, track file and registry changes 
		Browser or system crashes due to mishandling of resources 
			Mishandling of resources, single character can have consequences 
			Always have a backup, always test before deployment 
4.9 Given a scenario, use remote access technologies 
	Methods/tools 
		RDP - share desktop from remote location 
			RDP clients for macOS, Linux, etc. as well 
			Technical support 
			Open port of tcp/3389 is a big tell for attackers 
				They can brute force it
				Same for VNC 
		VPN - encrypted private data traversing over public network 
			Concentrator - single device that handles encryption and decryption 
				may be integrated into firewall or something 
			Many deployment options, special crytographic hardware, and some software only options 
			Used with client software, sometimes built into OS 
			Can be on demand, or always on 
			VPN data is very secure
				Authentication is critical, this is what attackers attack 
				Should always use MFA (multifactor) with it 
		VNC (Virtual network computer) - RFB (Remote frame buffer) protocol 
			Clients for many OSs, many are open source 
			Technical support 
		SSH - over tcp/22. Telnet on tcp/23 is basically the same, but SSH is encrypted 
			Like VPN, data is too secure, theyll attack the server or a client 
			Public/private key pair is a way to authenticate 
			Certain accounts should be disabled, like root 
			Limit access to SSH by IP address 
		RMM (Remote monitoring and management)
			manage system from remote location
				Patch OS, remote login, anomaly monitoring, hardware/software inventory 
			Popular attack point, access should be limited 
			Auditing is important - know whos connecting and what theyre doing 
		MSRA (Microsoft remote assistance) 
			No firewall configurations or port forwarding required 
			User makes a request with details 
				Send an invitation 
			Technincian connects using the password in the request 
			Replaced with Quick Assist in windows 10 and 11 
			No ongoing RDP service, avoids unintended access 
			Email with invitation details is a concern, consider voice comms. 
			Ease of use could be a downside, social engineering 
		Third party tools 
			Screen sharing software - see and control a remote device 
				GoToMyPC, TeamViewer 
			Video conferencing software - multiuser meetings with video and audio 
				Zoom, WebEx
			File transfer software - Store and share documents in the cloud 
				Dropbox, Google Drive, Box.com 
			Desktop management software - manager end user devices and OSs 
				Citrix Endpoint Management, ManageEngine Desktop Central 
	Security considerations of each access method
