3.1 Given a scnario, troubleshoot common Windows OS problems 
	Common symptoms 
		BSOD (Blue screen of death) - Windows stop error 
			Bad hardware, drivers, applications
			Last known good login. system restore, rollback driver, safe mode 
			Reseat or remove hardware 
			Run hardware diagnostics
				Manufacturer or built into BIOS 
		Sluggish performance 
			Task manager - check for CPU, memory and power usage
			Performance tab to monitor for trends 
			Windows Updates
			Disk space open space 
			Heat flow, anitmalware 
		Boot problems - can't find the OS 
			Boot loader replaced or changed 
			Check boot drives, remove USB drives, reboot 
			Startup repair
				NTLDR (NT loader) missing
				Missing operating system 
				Boot to safe mode 
			BCD (Windows boot configuration database)
				manually reconfiguring the system 
				Recovery console: bootrec /rebuildbcd 
			NTLDR (NT loader) missing 
		Frequent shutdowns 
		Services not starting 
			Check device manager and event viewer. Could be bad driver or hardware 
			Try starting manually, check account permissions, confirm service dependencies 
				Check system files, reinstall application 
		Applications crashing - app stops working 
			Might just be an error message, or it just dissappears 
			Look at Event Log for useful information 
			Reliability Monitor - history of application problems. Checks for resolution 
			Reinstall application
		Low memory warnings 
			You'll get a message 
			Check task manager and close the largest processes 
			Virtual memory - more room for swapping applications 
				You can configure this in settings, increase it, etc. 
		USB controller resource warnings 
			Different controllers support a different number of endpoints. 
			Different devices require a different number of endpoints 
				Exceed it and you "run out of resources" 
			Move the device to a different interface
			USB 2 may support more endpoints 
			Match the interface to the device capabilities - 2 with 2 and 3 with 3
		System instability - general system failures
			Full diagnostic - could be anything 
			Hardware diagnostic and storage and memory checks 
			SFC (System file checker) - check files in the OS 
			Run an antimalware 
		No OS found 
		Slow profile load 
			Roaming user profile - desktop follows you to any computer and changes synced 
			Network latency makes this load slowly 
				Could be slow to login, or apply policies, etc. 
			Local domain center at the site would be better 
		Time drift - internal clock drifts over time 
			Enable automatic time - maybe manually if privacy settings 
	Common troubleshooting steps 
		Reboot - software bug gets solved 
			Or applications is using too much, so stops it 
			Memory leak slowly eating RAM - clears the RAM 
		Restart services 
			Services are apps in the background, no user interaction 
			Similar issues as above
			View status in Task Manager, services tab 
			Start, stop, restart, modify the service 
		Uninstall/reinstall/update applications 
			Problems with application files or configurations 
			Can do this in Control panel 
			Repair - install missing files, replace corrupted files, fix shortcuts, registry, drivers 
			Reset - remove all applciation data, factory reset, original installation
			Uninstall 
		Add resources - Check utilization on task manager 
			performance monitor - long term analysis
			Add or replace hardware
			Free up drive space yourself or with software 
		Verify requirements
			Check with the manufacturer - minimum hardware requirements 
				Or drivers, libraries, etc. 
			System information tells you your current situation 
		System file check - verify integrity of the OS 
			sfc /scannow 
		Repair Windows - from settings or the advanced boot options 
		Restore - install a previous configuration
			Pick restore point and let the system reboot 
		Reimage - faster than trying to find a tiny issue 
			Organizations may have prebuilt images so you dont waste time 
			At home, you have the built in recovery options 
		Roll back updates 
		Rebuild Windows profiles - profiles can be corrupted 
			User profile service failed to login, cannot be loaded 
			User documents may be missing 
			Delete the bad profile, create a new profile 
			Login with domain adminstrator rights 
				Rename the Username folder to save important files 
			Backup the user's registry 
			Delete the existing registry
			Restart the computer 
			Login to computer with user account 
				New profile is built under existing username folder 
			Login as domain adminstrator to copy over backup files 
			Dont copy the entire old profile smh 
3.2 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common PC security issues 
	Common symptoms 	
		Unable to access the network 
			Malware is poorly written, so could cause performance issues
			Also by design - doesn't want you to download help. Control by disabling you 
			OS updates could fail to keep you vulnerable 
			Reload or clean with a malware cleaner or recover from known good 
		Desktop alerts - browser push notifications 
			Pretends to be malware infection, need to download, etc. 
			Actual notifications only come from the antivirus utility
			You can disable browser notifications - create an allow list or disable all
			Scan for malware, cleanup, backup 
		False alerts regarding antivirus protection
			Browser or separate window. Asking to ressubscribe, system is locked, etc. 
			May need a specific removal tool from a trusted antivirus site. 
			Or delete everything and start from scratch
		Altered system or personal files - renamed system files,
			files dissapearing or encrypted, permissions changed, access denied, etc. 
			Missing/renamed files 
		Unwanted notifications within the OS 
		OS update failures
	Browser related symptoms
		Random/frequent pop-ups 
		Certificate warnings - someting isn't quite right, peak your attention 
			Check certificate details. date/time, improper signature, etc. 
		Redirection - instead of Google, browser goes somewhere else 
			Should never happen. Malware is most common cause 
			anitvirus isnt best 
			Delete everything and install fresh or known good backup. 
3.3 Given a scenario, use best practice procedures for malware removal
	Best practice is a clean reinstall, always. Malware removal is alright. 
	Known good back up or from original source. 
	But cleanup for the sake of recovering data, maybe. 
	
	1. Investigate and verify malware symptoms
		Odd error messages - app failures, securiy alerts. 
			Maybe the antivirus is literally showing you. 
		System performance issues - booting, app performance
		Research the malware 
	2. Quarantine infected systems 
		Disconnect from the network to keep it contained 
		Physical connections and wireless 
		Isolate all removable media, set them aside and treat them as contaminated 
		Prevent the spread - no file transfer or backups 
	3. Disable system restore in windows 
		Restore points make it easy to rewind, malware infects them 
		No need to save an infested configuration 
		Delete all restore points, removing all malware locations 
	4. Remediate infected systems 
		a. Update antimalware software
			Signature and engine updates 
			Automatic vs manual - manual is basically pointless 
			Malware can prevent you from updating, so copy from another computer 
				USB drive into infected system, and then quarantine it 
		b. Scanning an removal techniques 
			Built in is best, followed by trusted 3rd party 
			Maybe a standalone removal app 
			And then no way to know for sure, so now you should transfer files before destruction 
			Safe mode - limited version of the OS just to get it running 
				Could prevent bad stuff from running while allowing you to recover
			Preinstallation environment - WinPW - Recovery consol, bootable CD, USB, etc. 
			Maybe you need to repair your boot records, sectors, rebuild, etc. 
	5. Schedule scans and run updates 
		Built into the antivirus software, automatic updates and scans 
		Or task scheduler to do this on a schedule 
		OS system updates as well 
	6. Enable system restore and create a restore point in windows 
		Now you're clean, so you can turn this back on 
		Create a restore point and start populating again 
	7. Educate the end user 
		One on one personal training to avoid this in the future 
		Posters and signs with high visibility 
		Message board, like a physical one 
		Login messages
		Intranet page, documentation for the user to read 
3.4 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common mobile OS and applications issues 	
	Common symptoms
		Application fails to launch
			Restart phone
			Stop the app and restart it (force stop) 
			Update the app 
		Application fails to close/crashes 
			App hangs - it stops working while everything else is fine 
			Or app crashes, dissapears, error message 
			
			Restart device and try again 
			Update the app 
			Delete and reinstall the app 
		Application fails to update 
			This one doesnt update while every other app does 
			Manually update - force it to start, or maybe you have to enter credentials first 
			Restart the device and try to update again 
		Slow to respond 
		OS fails to update 
			Check available storage - removed unused clutter 
			Check download bandwidth, connect to WiFi 
			Try a different network connection - different network 
			Restart the device and try again 
		Battery life issues 
			Bad reception - always searching for signal 
				Airplane mode will save battery when you know your in a bad area 
			Aging battery - there's a limited number of recharges	
				Replace the battery
			Disable unnecessary features - wireless, BlueTooth, GPS 
			Check app battery usage 
		Randomly reboots 
			Check the OS and app version, up to date 
			Hardware check - battery health 
				Not much options 
			Contact Tech support, look at logs on the device 
		Connectivity issues 
			Intermittent connectivity 
				Move closer to access point, or try a different AP 
			No connectivity 
				Make sure its enable, proper credentials are given 
				Reset the device, can resolve it 
				Same for BlueTooth 
			BlueTooth 
			WiFi
			NFC - Limited troubleshooting 
				Device may enable/disable it, so check 
				Restart the device 
				If payment related, remove the card and add it again 
			AirDrop 
				Distance between devices should be within 30 ft. 
				Turn on WiFi and BlueTooth 
				Check AirDrop discovery options 
		Screen does not autorotate 
			Disable rotation lock 
			Restart the app, maybe the device is fine 
			Restart the device 
			Device support - could be a sensor problem 
3.5 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common mobile OS and application security issues 
	Security concerns 
		APK (Android package) source 
			Once its on the phone, it has huge level of access 
			Dont install APK files from untrusted source 
			iOS apps are curated by Apple, much safer 
			Android, Google Play is better, or another trusted source 
			Sideloading - installing from other sources, potentially causing problems 
		Developer mode  - enable developer specific settings 
			USB debugging, memory statistics, Demo mode settings 
			iOS and iPadOS - use Xcode. Must use macOS 
			Android - go to about phone and click build number 7 times 
		Root access/jailbreak 
			Purpose built - Mobile devices dont give direct access to the OS
			Rooting for Android, jailbreak for iOS is a way to gain access
			Install custom firmware, replacing the existing OS 
			Uncontrolled access - circumvent security features, sideload apps 
				MDM becomes useless 
		Bootleg/malicious application 
			Application spoofing 
				Appears to be a legitimate app, but is bootleg or malicious 
			Always check the source of a download, and legitimacy of app 
	Common symptoms 
		High network traffic - higher than normal use 
			May indicate malware
			Or Command and control signals sent from a central source 
			Check data use reports 
			Use 3rd part reporting app, from trusted source 
			Antimalware scan 
		Sluggish response time 
			Running slowly, screen lags, poor input response 
			Restart the device, check for OS and app updates 
			Close apps not in use 
			Factory reset and install needed apps 
		Data-usage limit notification
			Built in Android feature, but not iOS 
			Set a warning and limit 
				Can indicate malware infection, drill down on individual app usage 
				Run a malware scan 
		Limited internet connectivity 
		No internet connectivity 
			Malware doesnt want to be removed 
			Disable and enable WiFi, or airplane mode 
			Restart the device to clear the memory and reload drivers 
			Malware scan, find and remove the problem 
		High number of ads 
			Malware wants to show ads to make money 
			Adblockers could be even worse sometimes 
			Once installed, its not in the list of available apps 
			Run antimalware to remove it 
		Fake security warnings 
			Easiest way in - have the user install their malware 
			Warnings seem legitimate but are not actual issues 
			Malware can access user data and start doing stuff 
			Dont click, dont install. If you do, run malware scan. 
		Unexpected application behavior 
			Apps unexpectedly closes, has delays, that werent there before 
			Or it doesnt have all the normal features it has, or included features arent working 
			High battery utilization 
			update the app, check for malware 
		Leaked personal files/data 
			Unauthorized account access, or root access 
			Determine the cause of data breach 
				Perform app scan, malware scan 
			Factory reset and clean install 
			Check online data sources 
				iCloud, google, Onedrive
				Change passwords
